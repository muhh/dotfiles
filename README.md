# muhh dotfiles

My collection of configuration files for zsh, tmux and many other command line tools.

## Installation

Use [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm "thoughtbot/rcm Â· GitHub") for setup and management of all the dotfiles:

    cd ~
    git clone <repository> .dotfiles
    RCRC="$HOME/.dotfiles/rcrc" rcup -v
